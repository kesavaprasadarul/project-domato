This project is an initiative to create a Firebase API running on .NET Applications. The class library is built on Flurl and Newtonsoft.json.
To run this project, please create a Constants.cs file at the root of the project with the following:

```c#
namespace REST_Test0
{
    public static class Constants
    {
        public static string ProjectID = "your-project-id";
        public static string APIKey = "your api key";
    }
}
```
